#The Fantôme Collective Manifesto

Principles of the DAO and its Members

<ô>

The Fantôme Collective is a “secret” (anonymous) group of Artists, Developers, Scientists and Investors governed by a DAO. 

Its purpose is to disrupt the world of art, science and media, finding new, meaningful ways of work and legal monetary distribution way beyond the collection of NFTs. Members shall be organised in circles that will change and adapt as fit, leaning heavily into the concept of holacracy.

Processes, projects, financial decisions and new memberships will be voted on by the whole Collective in the DAO, ultimately carried out by Smart Contracts and stored on a blockchain.  

The Collective’s work shall be interconnected, intercultural, interdisciplinary, transparent and independent from politics and mainstream businesses. Privacy, Encryption and Decentralization are vital tools to enter this new stage of collective work. 

The Collective is subject to change. Each member shall have the right to propose a change of rules, have it voted on and – once it passed – thereby contributing to the development of the whole Collective. By design, The Fantôme Collective will never reach a final stage.

The Collective is transparent to its membersEvery type of work, service or funding shall be shared and communicated openly within The Collective. Questions regarding that matter from members of The Collective shall be answered openly and thoroughly to anyone from The Collective. Financial transactions shall be voted upon in the DAO, explained in detail if questioned, and carried by the whole Collective. 

The Collective is opaque to the outsideMembers, projects and methods are to be kept anonymous and secret to the open public unless voted otherwise by The Collective. The Collective will protect the identity and integrity of its members and assets by any means deemed appropriate to The Collective.

The Collective’s Wisdom is a collective assetWe are a selected group of Artists, Scientists, Developers and Investors. Every member of the collective has been carefully selected by democratic vote. He, she or it shall thus use democratic, transparent and fair means to convey his, her or its opinion to matters or projects of The Collective and refrain from using personal knowledge to the majority’s disadvantage / disinformation. Wisdom and Knowledge shall be freely shared and treated as “open source” among members of The Collective.

The Collective will not haste Albeit we mostly work anonymous, interconnections between developers, artists, investors and clients are the essence of our culture. To preserve this, we actively decline impossible timelines and budgets. Quality and excellence is our motivation. If someone wants work done by tomorrow, it will likely not meet  the expectations. We will not haste to achieve mediocracy. In doubt, The Collective will vote on that affair in the DAO. Do act impulsively and aim for quick gratification. Neuroscience proves that the prefrontal cortex falls for low-hanging fruits and destructive behaviour in the long run.

The Collective supports itself Members will have to contribute a certain amount of financial means to The Collective’s DAO in order to join The Collective. The exact amount will be set by democratic vote of The Collective itself and is subject to change after a democratic vote has been passed.  Investors – if membership is granted by vote of The Collective – will be regular members of The Collective with equal voting rights. Their financial contribution will be a common share in The Collective’s bank, allowing them to ragequit as can every other member. Projects of The Collective itself, such as self-marketing activities, will be funded by The Collective and paid by the DAO bank.Revenue of projects will go into the shared bank (DAO bank) of The Collective. Each member can ragequit any time and get his/her/its fair share as deemed by the algorithms of The Collective funds at that time.
